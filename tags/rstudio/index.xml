      <description>rstudioâ€™s annual conference went online and global this year, which meant that I could attend for the first time. There were lots of interesting talks, and it was great to see familiar faces from GitHub/Twitter avatars come to life! This is a summary of the notes I took during the talks I attended, including  links to watch the full talk where available; to see all the available talk videos visit the rstudio website.</description>
